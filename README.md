## Background
In Singapore, the most common type of residential dwelling are HDB flats, public housing that is constructed by the Housing & Development Board of Singapore. With [77%](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/find-data/search-by-theme/households/households/latest-data#:~:text=1.8-,Average%20Household%20Size%20of%20Resident%20Households%204/,e.g.%20non%2DHDB%20shophouses%20etc.) of Singapore Residents staying in HDB flats, it is no surprise that that there is a lot of interest in the resale prices of HDB flats. 

Despite the availability of public transaction data, many real estate agents and homeowners in Singapore struggle to accurately price HDB resale flats, leading to prolonged listings, undervaluation, or missed opportunities. 


## Problem Statement
For years, WOW! agents have been leaning on the selling point that convenience sells. The closer a flat is to amenities such as hawker centers, shopping malls, or public transportation, the easier it is to pitch to prospective clients. Following the recent annual review, the management of WOW! Agency wants to review this is still the case.

There are many factors that afffect the resale prices of HDB flats, from proximity to amenities to remaining lease. In order to stay informed of the market prices, real estate agents from WOW! Agency require a data-driven approach to offer competitive pricing advice for their clients looking to purchase or sell HDB flats, and accurately estimate HDB resale flat values for different flat types and locations.
